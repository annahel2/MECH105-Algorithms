# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created for MECH105, utilizing different numerical methods.
## **False Position**
False Position is a root finding closed bracketing method
## **LU Decomposition**
LU Decomposition turns an matrix of data into an upper and lower triangular matrix
## **Simpson's 1/3**
Simpson's 1/3 is a code that is the integration method that can solve data that is not continuous numerically.
