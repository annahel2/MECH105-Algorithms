# **Simpson's 1/3**
Simpson's 1/3 is a code that is the integration method that can solve data that is not continuous
## Inputs
Inputs include:
- x: a vector containg equally spaced independent variables
- y: the function values with respect to x
## Outputs
Outputs include:
- I: the value found using the integration method
## Limitations
- inputes must be the same length, unequal vector sizes returns an eroor
- if there is an uneven number of segments the trapezoid will be implemented in the last run
